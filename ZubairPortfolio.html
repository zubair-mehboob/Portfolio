            <h1>WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
            <p>If you want to make a dynamic/static website you should hire me.
                Remember to treat others with empathy and respect. You want to be the kind of developer who lifts up everyone else around you, not someone who only works well in isolation.
            </p>

            <p id="intro"><em><strong> Zubair Mehboob Chishty</strong></em> is an energetic person, his love with his work is infinite. 
                 He has done MSc Applied Physics with specialize in Electronics. He put all his effort while fullfilling his duties. 
                 Successful developers don’t bring their egos to work. No matter how good you are at what you do, you’re not always going to be right. Other team members might have constructive criticism during code review, or your code might have bugs that you only find out about after shipping the product.

When this happens, you have to be OK with other people pointing out and correcting your errors. That’s why humility is such an important quality for developers to have.

The ability to take criticism and corrections from others, and then channel this into learning what you can do better, will make you a much better developer in the long run.
